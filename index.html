So we can light billions of dollars on fire? &#x27;Cause that&#x27;s what highway expansion is.</p><p>Houston, LA, every place they spend billions of dollars on highway expansion, traffic does not get better!</p><p>Traffic gets? (WORSE!)</p><p>Traffic gets? (WORSE!)</p><p>My message is simple:</p><p>if anyone wants to be a leader of this state,</p><p>or a leader of this country,</p><p>you can&#x27;t fight for projects that make climate change worse.</p><p>It ain&#x27;t 1980, it ain&#x27;t 1990, it ain&#x27;t 2000.</p><p>It is 2022, we have seen the effects of climate change.</p><p>So the message to Governor Murphy, to every single person supporting this project, is: <strong>rethink this.</strong></p><p>You&#x27;re not going to make anyone&#x27;s lives better, and in fact you&#x27;re going to rip through the fabric of this city.</p><p>We&#x27;re saying (hell no!) <strong>hell no</strong>, we are not gonna expand this turnpike.</p><p>Thank you.</p></blockquote>
